This plugin provides a set of remappings to make moving lines around in `vim` easier.

I found this set of remappings on this [VimTricks substack post](https://vimtricks.substack.com/p/vimtrick-moving-lines), and Colin Bartlett credits them to Steve Carol.

## Installation

```bash
Plug 'alichtman/move-lines.vim'
```

## Usage

In any mode (insert, normal, or visual):

- `Alt-j` to move a line down
- `Alt-k` to move a line up
