# move-lines.vim

This plugin provides a set of remappings to make moving lines around in `vim` easier.

I have this set of remappings credited to https://vimtricks.substack.com/p/vimtrick-moving-lines, and Colin Bartlett credits these to Steve Carol.


## Installation

```bash
Plug 'alichtman/move-lines.vim'
```
